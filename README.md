## UW-Madison salaries

Following up on an effort by [UFAS](https://ufas223.org),
the [Wisconsin University Union (WUU)](https://www.wuu.info)
will be regularly submitting Open Records Requests to obtain
information on UW-Madison employees' salaries,
and making the data available.

The present repository seeks to provide a tool for comparing a
UW-Madison employee's salary to others with the same title. It is
based on the design of Harald Kliems's [TTC Salary mapping
tool](https://haraldkliems.shinyapps.io/My_TTC_salary/).

The data are also available on [google
drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kpRy_g0RB04DE2HWsEGa7aareKl6vdIj?usp=drive_link),
if you just want to download the Excel file.
